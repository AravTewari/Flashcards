# Flashcards
The Flashcards project from Hyperskill.org

In the module, you are asked to write code for a flashcards program. Essentially, the code gets terms and defintions, either in the form of importing from a file or asking the user from console, and stores them in a linked hashmap as keys and values. The program can add or delete cards. The user can also be tested on how many number of cards they want to be tested on. The program will keep track of how many mistakes you make on each card in another hashmap and can return the card with most errors when asked. You can import and export the flashcards to a file, thus saving your session. The program also exports a log file to a .txt and stores it.

*Main.java of the final task can be found in "task/src/flashcards/Main.java"*
